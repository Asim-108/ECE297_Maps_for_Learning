# ECE297_Maps_for_Learning
GIS targeted towards students


This is a GIS mapping software that was developed in the ECE297 course at the University of Toronto. The team members for this course were Asim Rahman, Andrew Cheung and Chloe Soong. This map was made using open source materials and APIs from OSMdatabase.

We tailor made this mapping software for students, and as such we have tailor made features and the likes for them.

This mapping software also includes an A* path finding algorithm, that uses the euclidean distance from destination as a heuristic. The travelling salesman problem for this mapping software was solved using a combination of multi-start Dijkstra's algorithm, greedy algorithm, permutations to find better solutions, and more.
